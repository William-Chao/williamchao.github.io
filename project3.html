									<h1>The Impact of MLDA on Alcohol Consumption</h1>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/MLDA.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) has been a topic of hot contention amongst students, lawmakers, and academics. 
									The current MLDA is set at 21, and it is illegal for minors, those below 21, to purchase alcohol. 
									A growing support for lowering the MLDA to 18 has re-emerged in recent years, especially amongst college students. 
									People petitioning to lower the minimum drinking age hypothesizes the ineffectiveness of MLDA at decreasing alcohol consumption and 
									argues for the fact that MLDA is the only age restriction that is set at 21, citing examples such as Voting Eligibility and 
									Minimum Age for Serving the United States Armed Forces, which are both set to 18 . 
									Changes to MLDA will not only change the amount of alcohol consumption and alcohol related vehicle fatalities in minors, 
									but it would also affect the overall economy. The decrease in MLDA would lead to an increase in alcohol consumption, 
									increased alcohol consumption could bring about changes in alcohol related taxes, which would bring changes in government revenue. </p>
								<p>In order to find out the effect of MLDA on alcohol consumption, I collected traffic accident data from 1975 to 1983. 
									These traffic accidents are then categorized under different causes, which includes drunk driving.
									 The dataset includes over 28 thousand observations over an eight-year period, which is large enough to provide a good sample for my models.</p>
								<p>I first implemented regular Ordinary Least Squared model to analyze the impact of the policy on alcohol related vehicle accidents. 
									Although this does not directly measure the impact of 21-MLDA on alcohol consumption, 
									the effect on alcohol related vehicle accidents should provide insights to changes in alcohol consumption. 
									By setting drunk driving as the dependent variable and using year and policy as independent variables,
									 I find that the amount of alcohol related vehicular accidents were increasing each year and that the 21 MLDA policy decreased 
									 the probability of drunk driving by seven percent. Although the regression analysis has proven the relationship between policy 
									 implementation and drunk driving, it does not accurate capture the magnitude of the impact as it does not account for the underlying 
									 trend in drunk driving. Therefore, I employed difference-in-difference model to better examine the effectiveness of the policy. 
									 By examining states that had implemented the change in comparison to states that remained the same, I was able to eliminate any 
									 underlying trend for alcohol consumption. For this reason, I will be using New York and New Jersey to estimate the impact of the policy 
									 as New Jersey increased MLDA to 21 in 1983 while MLDA in New York remained at 18 till 1985. New York and New Jersey are good samples to
									  study as they have similar characteristics in population due to their proximity to one another. 
									  The data that will be used for this research paper will be collected from 1975 to 1983. Alcohol related vehicular deaths will the 
									  dependent variable. The control group is New York, and the treatment group will be New Jersey. The time variable will be 1983 as 
									  we want to see the differences between before and after the implementation of the policy. 
									  Finally, the effect of the MLDA will be captured in beta 3, where the differences between the treatment group from before 1983 and 
									  after 1983 are compared to the differences between the control group from before and after 1983. </p>
