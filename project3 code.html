									<h1>Analysis of Effectiveness of MLDA</h1>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/code.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The data on traffic accidents are collected from Fatality Analysis Reporting System, 
									which is created by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 
									The dataset contains fatal accidents as well as the causes of them for all fifty states from 1975 to 1983.
									Only the state of New York and New Jersey are included in the dataset; 
									furthermore, I will only be looking at the column for drunk driving. 
									Drunk driving will serve as a measurement for alcohol consumption as consumption data was not obtainable and 
									could easily be manipulated intentionally and unintentionally. 
									Drunk driving equals one if the individual had a police-reported alcohol involvement or a positive alcohol test result. 
									In addition to records of accidents, I have also gathered population data using Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED) for 
									both states from 1900s. They were then trimmed to match the time range of traffic accident report data.

										 if (x.style.display === "none") {
											x.style.display = "block";
										} else {
											x.style.display = "none";
										}
									}
									</script>
								</p>
								<p>However, the dataset downloaded are created on an annual basis. Therefore, I combined all of the annual data into on large dataset.
									In addition, unnecessary columns and states were excluded to simply the dataset. Furthermore,
									 population data are later added to match the year and state of each observation.

									</div>	
									<script>
										function myFunction2() {
										  var x = document.getElementById("myDIV2");
										  if (x.style.display === "none") {
											x.style.display = "block";
										  } else {
											x.style.display = "none";
										  }
										}
									</script>
								</p>
								<p> The fixed effect model in conjunction with difference-in-difference model shows the impact of MLDA on drunk driving while
									fixing for differences in years as well as populations. The variable we are interested in is "TreatAfter", as it captures the 
									impact of MLDA. As we can see in the picture below, the coefficient for "TreatAfter" is -0.12, suggesting 21-MLDA decreased drunk
									driving fatalities by 12 percent. The asterisk symbols at the right side shows that the impact is statistically significant.
								</p>
								<p> In addition to finding the impact of MLDA on drunk driving fatalities, difference-in-difference model also finds the differences between
									the control and treatment group before and after treatment. I find that New Jersey had a higher number of drunk driving accidents. 
									The coefficient for treatment variable is 0.21, suggesting New Jersey had 21 percent more drunk driving accidents than New York. 
									The percentage of drunk driving accidents can be found under the intercept of the model, which is 0.056, suggesting over 5 percent of 
									the accidents in New York are caused by drunk driving before 1983. On the other hand, the percentage of drunk driving for New Jersey 
									prior to 1983 is over 25 percent. The next variable is the time variable, which measure the differences in the number of drunk driving
									 accidents between 1983 and the years before. The coefficient for time variable is 0.258, suggesting the number of drunk driving 
									 accidents increased by 25.7 percent in 1983. In order to interpret the percent of accidents caused by drunk driving for New York in 1983, 
									 coefficient of the time variable needed be added to the intercept, which shows over 30 percent of the accidents are caused by drunk driving.
