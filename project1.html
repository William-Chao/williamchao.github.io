									<h1>The Impact of Race on Employment</h1>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/employment.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>In order to analyze the degree of racial discrimination in employment, 
									I used IPUMS to gather data on individualsâ€™ employment status, age, race, and education over a three-year period.
									 The data initially includes over 9 million observations. 
									 However, I have deducted those individuals that are not in the labor force or do not have data on employment status. 
									 The final dataset includes over 4.5 million observations.
									  The large amount of data in the sample should provide a good representation of the overall population. 
									  Furthermore, I have collected data from two time periods. The first study includes data from 2008 to 2010, 
									  and the second study includes data from 2017 to 2019.
									  Using these two datasets, I can compare and contrast the degree 
									 of racial preferences over the decade and study whether racial discrimination in employment has decreased over the years.</p>
								<p>For both sets of the data, I first used regular Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model to estimate the impact of race on employment.
									 I find that African Americans and Native Americans suffer significantly in employment preferences while Asian Americans and Caucasian Americans being most preferred. 
									 Furthermore, it shows education and previous working experience to be highly impactful on employment probability; 
									 one year increase in education increases probability of employment by one percent, and if an individual was working the year before, 
									 the probability of employment increases by 93 percent. Although simple to implement, 
									 OLS models could produce inaccurate estimates as coefficient could be over 1 and below 0 for binomial dependent variable. 
									 Therefore, I employed Probit model to more accurate measure the effect as the dependent variable, employed, is a binomial variable. 
									 The findings of relationships between varialbes in the Probit model were consistent with that generated by OLS model. However, some of their
									coefficients changed drastically.
									 Lastly, I implemented fixed effect model to adjust for any differences in years. For the first set of data, 
									 I find that Asian Americans men and women are one percent and 0.5 percent more likely to be hired respectively, 
									 African Americans and Native Americans faced the highest amount of employment discrimination as they are 2.4 percent and 2.9 percent less likely to be hired. 
									 In addition, a one standard deviation increase in education increases probability of being hired by 1.5 percent and previously working experience increases hiring probability by eight percent. 
									 The second set of data shows that racial discrimination has decreased over the decade as all of the coefficients were, 
									 although slightly, statistically significantly reduced.</p>
