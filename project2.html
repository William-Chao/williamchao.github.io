									<h1>Impact of Trade War on Domestic Economy</h1>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/trade_war.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Americans are no strangers to protectionist policies. The Tariff Act of 1789 was the first major tariff policy passed by the 
									congress. It generated the first source of government revenue . Protectionist policies, such as tariffs and quotas, 
									increases the cost of goods for foreign products and effectively protects domestic industries from foreign competitions. 
									While protectionist policies can promote domestic manufacturing and production, it could also affect trade and economic growth. 
									Previous studies have shown a mixed relationship between protectionist policies and economic growth. 
									While some have found evidence of negative impact of protectionist policy; 
									others found a positive correlation between protectionist policy and economic growth. 
									In recent years, there is a growing movement of protectionism and anti-globalization in the economic superpowers of the world. 
									From Brexit to Trump’s “America First” policies, the sentiment around the world seems to have derailed from the globalization mentality and reverted back to protectionism. </p>
								<p>In order to measure the impact of the protectionist policies on U.S. domestic economy, 
									I have created a panel data consisted of United States’ gross domestic products, imports and exports, 
									and trade wars over the past 20 years. I first used regular Ordinary Least Squared model to estimate the impact of trade war on domestic economy. 
									I found that protectionist policies were positively correlated with economic growth. 
									However, this estimate is subject to omitted variable bias as not all factors that affects GDP were included in the regression. 
									Therefore, I implemented the Fixed Effects model to control for any differences in years. 
									Using fixed effect model, I find that exports and imports decreased by 30 percent and45 percent perceptively and GDP decreased by 9.5 percent. 
									Furthermore, protectionist policies have different impact on foreign countries as over 470 percent decrease in Chinese GDP were associated with protectionist policies. </p>
