									<h1>How Does Minimum Wage Impact State Economy</h1>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/miniwage.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Minimum wage is a highly delicate topic in all fields of study as it directly impacts the wellbeing of those earning a minimum wage.
								  The current federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour with the highest at $15 per hour in the bay area. 
								  The federal minimum wage has seen a steady incline over time, from $0.25 in 1938 to $7.25 in 2009. 
								  In the political field, progressive politicians tend to promote an increase in minimum wage to support those families living in poverty. 
								  They argue that the current minimum wage provides an unlivable salary and an increase in minimum wage would increase economic growth as 
								  people will be able to spend more money. Conservative party, on the other hand, argues that a drastic increase in minimum wage would cause an 
								  increase in unemployment as companies would have to supplement the increase in employment cost by decreasing the number of employees hired, therefore, 
								  it would negatively impact the economic growth. </p>
								<p>While there are macroeconomic models that supports both parties’ claims, 
								  these models are often based off of assumptions and are often revised and improved upon as economists discover and 
								  improve their understandings of economic at the macro level. For example, the Modern Monetary Theory supports democrat’s idea that the fed can print 
								  as much money as it is needed to support full employment as inflation won’t increase a lot as the increase in aggregate demand is balanced by the 
								  increase in long run aggregate supply. However, a main critique of this model is that it does not incorporate expected inflation. 
								  The surprise aggregate supply hypothesis, along with the rational expectation hypothesis and continuous market clearing assumption, 
								  makes up the New Classical Model. Under the New Classical Model, it shows that any policies that aims to increase or decrease the employment rate 
								  would be temporary. It shows that an anticipated policy would have no effect on output and employment, and an unanticipated policy could only impact the 
								  variables in the short run. Furthermore, quantity of money theory shows that money is neutral. As wages increase, so will the price of goods; therefore, 
								  the real purchasing power remain the same.</p>
														<p>To analyze the impact of minimum wage on state GDP, I have opted to use the difference-in-difference modle; I will then forecast state level GDP from 2020 to 2025.
								  For the difference-in-difference model, Pennsylvania is the control state and New Jersey is the treatment state. Pennsylvania and New Jersey shared similar growth in
								  GDP in the late 90’s and early 2000’s due to their close proximity to one another. From 1998 to 2005, both states’ minimum wages were unchanged. However, in 2006, 
								  New Jersey increased its minimum wage while minimum wage in Pennsylvania remained the same. Therefore, Pennsylvania is the perfect control state for our natural 
								  experiment as we can observe the expected growth in New Jersey based off of the GDP growth in Pennsylvania; any major deviation from the expected growth will be 
								  contributed to the impact of minimum wage.</p>
														<p>Using difference-in-difference model, I find that the impact of minimum wage on GDP to be positive. The coefficient for the variable is 0.01, 
								  suggesting a one percent increase in New Jersey’s GDP in 2006 is correlated with the increase in minimum wage. However, the coefficient was not statistically 
								  significant. Therefore, I cannot reject the null hypothesis that minimum wage has no effect on GDP. Furthermore, I used the same approach to analyze the impact of 
								  minimum wage increase on GDP growth. The coefficient for the variable was 6418, suggesting the increase in minimum wage in New Jersey increased the states GDP growth
								  by $6,418 millions of dollars. Similar to that of the impact on GDP, the change in GDP growth was not statistically significant. I once again failed to reject the 
								  null hypothesis that minimum wage has no impact of GDP growth. </p>
